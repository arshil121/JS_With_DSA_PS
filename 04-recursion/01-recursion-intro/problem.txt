In this example, we have a function called `countDown` that takes in a number. We have what we call the `base case`, which is when the number is less than or equal to 0. If this is true, we log "All done!" and return. If it is not true, we run the `recursive case`, which will log the number, subtract 1 from it, and then call the function again with the new number. This will continue until the number is less than or equal to 0.

We are calling the same function with a smaller number each time. This is recursion.
