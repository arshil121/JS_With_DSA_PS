Write a function called `diceGameSimulation` that simulates this dice game. The function should take one argument:

- `numSimulations`: The number of times to simulate the dice game.

The game rules are if a 7 or 11 are rolled, the player wins and they get a result of `win`. If a 2, 3 or 12 are rolled they lose and get a result of `lose`. Anything else and they get a result of `roll again`.

The function should return an array of objects, where each object represents a simulation result. Each object should contain the following properties:

- `dice1`: The value of the first dice (a random number between 1 and 6).
- `dice2`: The value of the second dice (a random number between 1 and 6).
- `sum`: The sum of the two dice values.
- `result`: The result of the roll, which can be "win", "lose", or "roll again".
