Write a function called `displayLikes` that takes in an array of names and returns a string of who likes the post.

The function should return a string formatted as follows:

- If no one likes it, it should return `'no one likes this'`
- If one person likes it, it should return `'{name} likes this'`
- If two people like it, it should return `'{name1} and {name2} like this'`
- If three people like it, it should return `'{name1}, {name2} and {name3} like this'`
- If more than three people like it, it should return `'{name1}, {name2} and {x} others like this'`
