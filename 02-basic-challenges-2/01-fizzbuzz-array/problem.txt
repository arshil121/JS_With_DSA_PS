FizzBuzz is probably the most common interview question for entry level developers. At least, it used to be. It may not be used as much because of how common it was. It's a simple problem that tests your ability to think logically and write clean code.

Traditionally, you loop from 1 to 100 and print out each number. However, if the number is divisible by 3, you print out "Fizz" instead. If the number is divisible by 5, you print out "Buzz" instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print out "FizzBuzz" instead.

In this challenge, you will write a function called `fizzBuzzArray` that takes in a number and returns an array. The array should contain all the numbers from 1 to the number passed in. However, if the number is divisible by 3, you should replace the number with "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, you should replace the number with "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you should replace the number with "FizzBuzz".
